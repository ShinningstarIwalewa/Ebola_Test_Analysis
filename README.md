# Ebola_Test_Analysis
A new medical test is in development for detecting Ebola that is much faster, though less accurate, than that currently available. The new test has been applied to some patients who are known (from the old test) to have the disease or not. The results of these patients are available in `ebola_test.csv`. The first column of this data set (called `prob`) is the probabiliy under the new test that the patient has Ebola. The second column (`ebola`) is the result from the older test which definitively says whether the  patient has ebola (`ebola = 1`) or not (`ebola=0`).
